               one weekly HIT session and focus on low-intensity training (LIT)
               (BP; n = 10, VO2max = 62 $\pm$ 2 mL/kg/min). Another group of
               cyclists performed a more traditional organization, with 4 weeks
               of two weekly HIT sessions interspersed with LIT (TRAD; n = 9,
               VO2max = 63 $\pm$ 2 mL/kg/min). Similar volumes of both HIT and
               LIT was performed in the two groups. While BP increased VO2max ,

               relative improvements in VO2max compared with TRAD (P < 0.05).
               Mean effect size (ES) of the relative improvement in VO2max ,

               study suggests that block periodization of training provides
               superior adaptations to traditional organization during a 4-week
               endurance training period, despite similar training volume and

               different methods of organizing endurance training in trained
               cyclists during a 12-week preparation period. One group of
               cyclists performed block periodization (BP; n = 8), wherein
               every fourth week constituted five sessions of high-intensity
               aerobic training (HIT), followed by 3 weeks of one HIT session.
               Another group performed a more traditional organization (TRAD; n
               = 7), with 12 weeks of two weekly HIT sessions. The HIT was
               interspersed with low-intensity training (LIT) so that similar
               total volumes of both HIT and LIT were performed in the two
               groups. BP achieved a larger relative improvement in VO2max than
               TRAD (8.8 $\pm$ 5.9\% vs 3.7 $\pm$ 2.9\%, respectively, < 0.05)

               superior effects of BP compared with TRAD training (ES range was
               0.62-1.12). The present study suggests that BP of endurance

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Block periodization (BP) has been proposed as an
               alternative to traditional (TRAD) organization of the annual
               training plan for endurance athletes. OBJECTIVE: To our
               knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the
               effect BP of endurance training on endurance performance and
               factors determinative for endurance performance in trained- to
               well-trained athletes. METHODS: The PubMed, SPORTdiscus and Web
               of Science databases were searched from inception to August
               2019. Studies were included if the following criteria were met:
               1) the study examined a block-periodized endurance training
               intervention; 2) the study had a one-, two or multiple group-,
               crossover- or case-study design; 3) the study assessed at least
               one key endurance variable before and after the intervention
               period. A total of 2905 studies were screened, where 20 records
               met the eligibility criteria. Methodological quality for each
               study was assessed using the PEDro scale. Six studies were
               pooled to perform meta-analysis for maximal oxygen uptake
               (VO2max) and maximal power output (Wmax) during an incremental
               exercise test to exhaustion. Due to a lower number of studies
               and heterogenous measurements, other performance measures were
               systematically reviewed. RESULTS: The meta-analyses revealed
               small favorable effects for BP compared to TRAD regarding
               changes in VO2max (standardized mean difference, 0.40; 95\%
               CI=0.02, 0.79) and Wmax (standardized mean difference, 0.28;
               95\% CI=0.01, 0.54). For changes in endurance performance and
               workload at different exercise thresholds BP generally revealed
               moderate- to large-effect sizes compared to TRAD. CONCLUSION: BP
               is an adequate, alternative training strategy to TRAD as
               evidenced by superior training effects on VO2max and Wmax in
               athletes. The reviewed studies show promising effects for BP of
               endurance training; however, these results must be considered
               with some caution due to small studies with generally low
               methodological quality (mean PEDro score =3.7/10).",
